# Todos Assesment

So what we have here is a very simple todos app, built using React for the view layer, and Redux as the state container. If you're unfamiliar
with either of these technologies, a little bit of googling should enlighten you nicely. All of the Javascript is written in ES6.

## Lets get started!

First off, you need to have node and npm installed. If you've haven't done that yet, go ahead, we'll wait for you.

In order to launch this application, you'll need to first clone the repository. Next up, install the dependencies:

`npm install`

And then start the application:

`npm start`

If all has gone well, you should now be able to navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Taking stock of our app

As you can see, our app right now is pretty weak. We can add items to our ToDo list, and cross them off, but not much else. Also, this is about
the least amount of pop our design team could imagine.

## Your developer tasks

1) We can't even show our progress to a client yet, there is no style whatsoever here. Make it look nicer. There's no need to reinvent the
wheel here, you're allowed (encouraged even) to use some open source project(s) to help you along.

2) Hey, I don't actually want to do my todo, but I can't delete it. That's no good. Add this functionality in.

3) I'm really proud of having completed my ToDo, I wish there was a way I could tell everyone how awesome I am. Please add a way to 
share my completed ToDo on either Twitter or Facebook.

4) BONUS! Right now we lose all our ToDo's as soon as we refresh the page. It'd be really nice save these off somewhere so we don't lose
the information. Do this somehow.

## Rules of the road

1) We want to see how you work, and how you think, so it makes sense that we'd want you to do this yourself. That being said, google 
is your friend, feel free to search the web for anything you think might help you.

2) Once you're ready to submit, push your updated repository to a public repo on Github or Bitbucket, and send us a link.

## Tips

1) Testing is always a good idea

2) Commit often

3) You're better off taking a stab at all of the problems versus leaving them untouched
